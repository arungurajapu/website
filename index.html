		<h1>What is CSS?</h1>
		<p>
			1.CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
            2.CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
            3.CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
            4.External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

		<h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
		<p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>

		<p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

			HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
			
			<h1>This is a heading</h1>
			
			<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
			
			When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
			
			To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
			
			CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>

		<h2>What is CSS Syntax?</h2>
		<p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

			The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
			
			Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
			
			Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>

		<h2>What are CSS Selectors?</h2>
		<p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

			We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
			
			Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
			Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
			Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
			Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
			Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
			This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.

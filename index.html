		<h2>What is CSS Syntax?</h2>
		<p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

			The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
			
			Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
			
			Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>

		<h2>What are CSS Selectors?</h2>
		<p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

			We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
			
			Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
			Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
			Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
			Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
			Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
			This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.
